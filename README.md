# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

I coded Connect Four using Python. Connect Four is a two player game where the players choose where to place their pieces. The goal of the game is to connect four pieces together. The first player in the game has pieces indicated by the letter "P." The second player in the game has pieces indicated by the letter "C." The players take turns placing a piece from the top of the grid into the bottommost open spot on the grid. Once four pieces of the same letter are connected, the according player wins and the game ends.

I used the following resource to help me code Connect Four:

“Try and Except in Python.” Python For Beginners, www.pythonforbeginners.com/error-handling/python-try-and-except.

The final version of the code can be found in the file "connectfourfinal."
